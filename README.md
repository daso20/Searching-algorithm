Searching algorithm with GUI based on Dijkstra's algorithm. 
Main functionality is to find the most optional path in a graph between 2 selected vertices. 

Items that can be defined:
- Vertices
- Edges between vertices
- Beginning/end vertices pair

The controls are:

1.- Left click
- Defines a new vertex
- Connects 2 vertices. First a vertex is selected and turned green, then an edge is created after clicking on another vertex

2.- Right click

Sets beginning or end vertex
  
3.- Return

Runs Dijkstra's algorithm on current graph with selected beginning/end vertices pair

4.- R

Clears windows and all defined values
