Searching algorithm with GUI based on Dijkstra's algorithm. 
Main functionality is to find the most optional path in a graph between 2 selected vertices. 

Items that can be defined:
- Vertices
- Edges between vertices
- Beginning/end vertices pair

The controls are:
* Left click
- Defines a new vertex
- Connects 2 vertices. First a vertex is selected and turned green, then an edge is created after clicking on another vertex

* Right click
Sets beginning or end vertex
  
* Return:
Runs Dijkstra's algorithm on current graph with selected beginning/end vertices pair

* R:
Clears windows and all defined values
